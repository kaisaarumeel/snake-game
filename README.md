#### <ins>**Eating food**</ins>


On the field, a mouse is spawned  at a random position. It is never located at the tile currently occupied by any part of the Snake. The user should move the head of the Snake to the same tile, where the Mouse is placed in order to “eat” it. Once the mouse is eaten, the snake grows by one body part and a new mouse is spawned in the field. Moreover, with every mouse eaten, the score of the player increases by 1. Eating the mouse, or more like trying to do that, is a part of the game that makes it entertaining since firstly, it enables the player to get a higher score and secondly, it is challenging to actually make the Snake move in the right direction to consume the Mouse. Moreover, the Game is getting more and more demanding as the Snake grows and it’s easier to bump into it, so the maneuvers need to be more deliberate in order not to lose.


#### <ins>**Saving the Username and Score**</ins>

Once the game is over, the Game Over scene is shown where the player can save the score they have just obtained by writing their name in the window and pressing the “Enter” key. The name of the previous player is always saved in the “Name” field so that the user does not have to type their name again every time. Once the user presses enter, the name and score are saved and added to the Leader Board if the score is high enough. If the user returns to the menu or starts a new game without saving the result right away, the result will be lost.
